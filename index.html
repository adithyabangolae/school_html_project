What is the PPH?

</h2>
</div>


<div class="intro">
<p> Hello, my name is <i>Adithya Bangolae </i>and I have created a pen holder made out of plastic(The PPH).
The PPH stands for PLASTIC PEN HOLDER.
Bassically, it is a pen holder which is made out of plastic.
The reason my product is made out of plastc is because my goal is to recycle plastic.
By recycling plastic, I can help stop plastic dumping. The PPH can hold up to 10 to 15 pens/pencils.
The PPH has 2 holes which gives you the ability to hang it on your wall.
It is 4 in. in width and 5 in. in length so it wont take a lot of space on your desk.
It is circular in shape and has 4 compartments.
The pen holder comes in many different types of colors.

What is plastic dumping?

</h2>
</div>

<div class="plastic">
<p>Pastic dumping is when a significant amount of plastic that is not recycled and is dumped on land and that creates huge piles of non-recycled plastic.
This can affect the environment.
Plastic dumping can also affect humans by releasing toxic chemicals into the atmosphere and that can affect people's health.
Out of 8.3 billion tons of plastic produced,6.3 billion tons of plastic has become plastic waste.
Over 2 million tonnes of plastic waste has dumped into oceans globally this year(2021) so far.
The plastic that is dumped into the piles will take 10-100 years to degrade so the plastic is going to stay there for a very long time </p>
